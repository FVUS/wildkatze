#  Description

The ratio of flow reaching the top outlet is compared with total flow coming in. A part of the flow shows up in side channel. If the convection scheme is more diffusive the flow going into side channel is higher. 

We take a very very coarse mesh and accurately predict this flow rate ratio demonstrating effictiveness and higher accuracy of the third order flow model in Wildkatze solver.

Calculation is performed for 5 different Reynolds Numbers (10, 100, 200, 300 and 400).  We set density equal to 1kg/m3 and viscosity equal to 0.001 Pa. Sec.
