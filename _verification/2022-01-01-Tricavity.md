# Flow in triangular cavity driven by moving wall


This validation case, comprises results of laminar fow induced in a triangular cavity, by a moving top wall and stationary side walls. Figure 1.1
shows the geometry, dimensions and bounday conditions of this case.

The fluid density is set to 1 kg/m 3 , the viscosity to 0.01 kg/(m Â· s) and the simulation is run in steady mode. After the simulation has reached a converged state, the velocity in x-direction is determined along a vertical line that bisects the tip of cavity. This x-velocity is then normalized by the velocity of the moving wall which is 2 m/s. In figure 1.2 this normalized x-velocity is plotted against the y-coordinate. This figure contains Wildkatze simulation results and experimental results taken from reference
