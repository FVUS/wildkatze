# Higher Order Methods Myths
Higher Order Methods  attractive as they  are always been shrouded in lot of myths about them. Most common of them are:
 <br/><br/>
### Higher Order Methods are only for Academia

This myth originates from the fact that there is no commercial software offering Third or Higher Order solver for finite volume forumulation. Indeed Wildkatze is first commercially available finite volume solver to offer Third Order SIMPLE solver. 

### Higher Order Methods are Unstable and Difficult to Converge

One of the reasons why no commercial software offers Higher Order Model is the reasons that so far it has been very difficult to have Higher Order method converge on unstructured meshes without giving up on accuracy. 

With Wildkatze we are able to demonstrate highly stable Third order solver on unstructured meshes even those including general polyhderals.  User does not have to worry about skew etc and it saves lot of time for the user.  Wildkatzeâ€™s Third Order solver is more stable than most CFD solvers available in the market. 

### Higher Order Methods are Costly

**Not anymore** 

The cost increase per iteration from Second Order to Third Order is typically between 40 to 70 percent. For unsteady problem the cost increase per time step could be kept around 30 to 40 percent. 

This off course comes with huge cost savings by using 10 times less coarse mesh.

 <br/><br/>

# Why Higher Order Methods
<br/><br/>
- Reduction of calculation cost by factor of 10 or more by using Third Order Flow model.
- A Third Order Flow model can achieve same level of accuracy as Second Order Flow model on meshes that are 10 times or less coarse. 
- Increase of accuracy from Second Order model even using the same fine mesh.

# Third Order Flow Model on Unstructured Meshes
<br/><br/>
Finite Volume Descretization is achieved through more integration points per face as opposed to 1 integration point per face in Second Order methods.
