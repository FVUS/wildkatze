# Higher Order Method Myths
Higher Order Methods  attractive as they  are always been shrouded in lot of myths about them. Most common of them are:
 <br/><br/>
### Higher Order Methods are only for Academia

This myth originates from the fact that there is no commercial software offering Third or Higher Order solver for finite volume formulation. Indeed Wildkatze is first commercially available finite volume solver to offer Third Order SIMPLE solver. 

### Higher Order Methods are Unstable and Difficult to Converge

One of the reasons why no commercial software offers Higher Order Model is the reasons that so far it has been very difficult to have Higher Order method converge on unstructured meshes without giving up on accuracy. 

With Wildkatze we are able to demonstrate highly stable Third order solver on unstructured meshes even those including general polyhderals.  User does not have to worry about skew etc and it saves lot of time for the user.  Wildkatzeâ€™s Third Order solver is more stable than most CFD solvers available in the market.
