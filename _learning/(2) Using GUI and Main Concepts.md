# Introduction

While setting up from command prompt is very fast and thanks to automated set up it is mostly possible to perform the simulation without ever opening GUI, it is useful to inform about the concepts of Wildkatze to utilize software to its fullest possibilities. There might be some small things that are not possible to set up from console. 

Since it is efficient to set up from console the end goal is to be able to set up everything from console. Note that advanced set up from console is done using configuration file. The explanation of this shall have its own dedicated article. 

The GUI mode or Client Server mode is two step process

-  Starting the server on some port (for example at port 5010) as ``` solver.sh -s 5010 ``` starts the server at port 5010
-  Launching the GUI by ``` solvergui.sh ``` or ``` java -jar  $HOME/dravvya/bin/WildkatzeGui.jar ``` with using appropiate location of jar file

We connect the client to server as
